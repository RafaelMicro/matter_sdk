# This is an example file, it will be ignored by VSC
# This file can be created with 2 methods.
# The first method consists in running the task "Find J-Link probes" which will find all the J-Link probes connected to the computer.
# This method is supported on Linux only.
# The task must be run everytime the setup is modified (a probe a disconnected, or a new one has been connected, etc)
#
# The second methode is manual, the user must create a file named jlink_setup.cfg in this folder and fill it with his own setup configuration
# The first label is a nickname, then comes the jlink serial number
# VSC will parse this file and ask the user to choose which board to flash and debug, using the nickname
