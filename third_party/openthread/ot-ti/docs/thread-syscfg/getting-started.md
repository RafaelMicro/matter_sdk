# Get started with SysConfig

System Configuration Tool (SysConfig) is a graphical interface for
configuring your project. Configuration files, C source files and header
files are generated based on the parameters configured in the SysConfig
dashboard.

SysConfig should be used as a standalone tool for script-based builds (such as for TI-OpenThread).

The below documentation will help for getting started in tailoring the syscfg file to your application needs.

> **_Attention:_**
Files and code generated by SysConfig should be thoroughly checked and
reviewed.

## Using Stand-alone SysConfig

You can find the standalone SysConfig tool on the [SysConfig Standalone
Installer Download Page](https://www.ti.com/tool/SYSCONFIG).

The location of the openthread syscfg file is located here: `/src/openthread.syscfg`
For example, on the github web: https://github.com/TexasInstruments/ot-ti/blob/release/thread-1.3-certification-support/src/openthread.syscfg
The local file in your cloned repository should be used.

This file is used by openthread build scripts, when it invokes SysConfig CLI.
In order to edit the file for your custom application configurations, you'll need to open the file with the SysConfig GUI.
Before doing so, you should add the following line:

```
// @cliArgs --product <path to SDK>/.metadata/product.json --board /ti/boards/LP_EM_CC1354P10_6 --rtos freertos
```

As an example, after adding the necessary `<path to SDK>`, it would look like:

```
// @cliArgs --product /home/Documents/repos/ot-ti/third_party/ti_simplelink_sdk/repo_cc13xx_cc26xx/.metadata/product.json --board /ti/boards/LP_EM_CC1354P10_6 --rtos freertos
```

If the file is not found, then you may need to first initialize the submodules:

```
git submodule update --init
```

Now you can open the file in SysConfig GUI.
Once you are done, remove the `@cliArgs` line then save the file. Now the ot-ti build scripts will use the updated .syscfg file.

## Viewing SysConfig Output

To preview the code to be generated reference the `Generated Files` image, the button at the top of
the `Configuration` pane you will find a list of Generated Files. After
selecting a file you will be able, in real-time, to identify how the
changes in the GUI affect the generated files. This will help you review
the relationship between the GUI and the code.

<div style="text-align: center;">
  <img src="resources/syscfg_generated_files_ble.png" alt="Generated Files">
  <div class="caption">Generated Files</div>
</div>

Whenever you re-build the project, SysConfig will re-generate the files.
Because of this, any changes made directly in the generated files will
be overwritten.
