# Thread Border Router

## Introduction

A Thread Border Router is a Thread Networkâ€™s connection to the outside world. A Border Router offers an off-mesh (external to the Thread Network) route for addressing packets. This allows a Thread Device connected to a Thread Network to communicate with an adjacent IPv6 network (an Internet Protocol version 6 network that the Border Router is also connected to: Wi-Fi or Ethernet, for example). In this way the Border Router facilitates device to device and device to cloud communication.
