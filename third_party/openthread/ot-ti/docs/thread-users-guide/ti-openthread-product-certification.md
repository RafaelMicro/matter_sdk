# Thread Product Certification

Thread certification is a necessary step to ensure interoperability with
existing Thread products. Each individual Thread product must go through
a process of certification in order to wear the Thread certified
interoperability logo.

> **__Attention__**
Thread product certification is not required if you are designing a
proprietary network setup using the Thread protocol. **However**, you
will not be awarded any IP rights or protections by not becoming a
Thread member and take a product through certification.

## OpenThread Certification
