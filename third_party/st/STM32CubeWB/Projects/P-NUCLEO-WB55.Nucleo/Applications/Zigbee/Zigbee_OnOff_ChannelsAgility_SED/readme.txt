@par Application Description 

How to use the OnOff cluster on a device on a Sleepy End Device (SED) acting as a Client within a Centralized Zigbee network.

The purpose of this application is to show how to create two (or more) Zigbee centralized network, and 
how to communicate from one node to another one of these networks using the OnOff cluster. Channel agility is used at the creation 
of each network, with the assignmemt of a different channel for each one. (by default: Channel 15 for network1 and Channel 20 for network2)

A number of experiments are described in this readme, with multiple ZC (ZigbeeCoordinator: ZC1, ZC2) and ZR (ZigbeeRouter: ZR1,ZR2):

- ZCx STM32WB55xx board loaded with: 
    - wireless coprocessor : stm32wb5x_Zigbee_FFD_fw.bin
    - application : Zigbee_OnOff_ChannelsAgility_ZC
    
- ZRx or more STM32WB55xx board loaded with: 
    - wireless coprocessor : stm32wb5x_Zigbee_FFD_fw.bin
    - application : Zigbee_OnOff_ChannelsAgility_ZR
    
- 1 STM32WB55xx board loaded with: 
    - wireless coprocessor : stm32wb5x_Zigbee_FFD_fw.bin
    - application : Zigbee_OnOff_ChannelsAgility_SED

Setup SUMMARY: At the end, network1 SED1--ZR1--ZC1 exist (within a distance of 5 meters), and network2 SED2--ZR2--ZC2 exist (likely on a different channel)

NOTE: Blue Led on SEDx : Blue LED is ON till a callback verifying that ACK fails. Saying differently: after the first fail of getting an ack, the the SED blue LED is turned OFF.
 This can be easily observed if the SED is moved 10 meters away from the ZR-ZC.  NOTE: tx_power is set to -20db in this application, hence radius limitation is about 5 meters.
 

  
To setup the application :

  a)  Open the project, build it and load your generated application on your STM32WB devices.
  
 Additional detailed comments on the application :

  a)  Start coordinator first. So in this demo application it is
      the device running Zigbee_OnOff_ChannelsAgility_ZC application (Device ZCx in the above diagram). 
      Wait for the Blue LED (LED1) ON. 
      Second board: Zigbee Router. This board is configured as Zigbee router and will attached to the network created 
      by the coordinator. Do the same for the other boards if applicable.
            
  b)  SED stage, the Zigbee network is automatically created and NO activity will be observed on any SED LED on all SED devices.
      it is possible to detect that the OnOff Toggle Cluster commands from the client SED to the server in unicast mode is succeeding. 
      You must see the RED LED (LED3) toggling on the CONNECTED ZC server side (Using same CHANNEL). In case of multiple ZC, the 4 seconds interval 
      allow to detect which SED is connected to which ZC.
      
  c)  ZR stage, the Zigbee network is automatically created when the BLUE LED (LED1) is ON on all ZR devices.
      it is now possible to send OnOff Cluster commands from the client ZR to the server in unicast mode 
      by pressing on the SW1 push button. 
      You must see the RED LED (LED3) toggling on the CONNECTED server side (Using same CHANNEL).

 Note: when LED1, LED2 and LED3 are toggling serially with an identical tempo it is indicating an error has occurred on application.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB55xx devices.
  
  - This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32WB55RG_Nucleo 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - On STM32WB55RG_Nucleo, the jumpers must be configured as described
    in this section. Starting from the top left position up to the bottom 
    right position, the jumpers on the Board must be set as follows: 

     CN11:    GND         [OFF]
     JP4:     VDDRF       [ON]
     JP6:     VC0         [ON]
     JP2:     +3V3        [ON] 
     JP1:     USB_STL     [ON]   All others [OFF]
     CN12:    GND         [OFF]
     CN7:     <All>       [OFF]
     JP3:     VDD_MCU     [ON]
     JP5:     GND         [OFF]  All others [ON]
     CN10:    <All>       [OFF]


@par How to use it ? 

=> Loading of the stm32wb5x_Zigbee_FFD_fw.bin binary

  This application requests having the stm32wb5x_Zigbee_FFD_fw.bin binary flashed on the Wireless Coprocessor.
  If it is not the case, you need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to load the appropriate binary.
  All available binaries are located under /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries directory.
  Refer to UM2237 to learn how to use/install STM32CubeProgrammer.
  Refer to /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/ReleaseNote.html for the detailed procedure to change the
  Wireless Coprocessor binary. 

=> Getting traces
  To get the traces you need to connect your Board to the Hyperterminal (through the STLink Virtual COM Port).
  The UART must be configured as follows:

    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits 
    - Stop Bit = 1 bit
    - Parity = none
    - Flow control = none
